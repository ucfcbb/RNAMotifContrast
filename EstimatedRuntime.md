### Runtime estimate for the provided inputs

In order to give an estimate of the required time to run the provided package, we are giving some example of fresh runs on our machine (Intel Core i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz × 12, 64 GB RAM; Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04):

```
For ‘sample1.in’,
Time for alignment = 2 minutes
Time for the whole pipeline = 3 minutes

For ‘sample2.in’,
Time for alignment = 10 minutes
Time for the whole pipeline = 27 minutes

For ‘supercluster_IL.in’,
Time for alignment = 16 hours 52 minutes
Time for the whole pipeline = 17 hours 37 minutes

For ‘supercluster_HL.in’,
Time for alignment = 11 minutes
Time for the whole pipeline = 1 hours 17 minutes
